# German Shorthaired

The German Shorthaired Pointer or Deutsch Kurzhaar is a German breed of continental pointing dog of Braque type. It originated in the nineteenth century in what is now Germany. It is of medium size, and is an all-purpose gun dog suitable for hunting and retrieving on both land and water. It may also be kept as a companion dog.

## History

The pointing dog breeds of Europe all derive from the now-extinct Old Spanish Pointer, which spread through France and the Low Countries and reached the princely houses of the German-speaking world,where at first they were used in bird-hunting with nets or falcons, and later by huntsmen with guns. Bird dogs were also brought from England; Carl von Heppe, in his Aufrichtiger Lehrprinz of 1751, describes these as taller and stronger than the local type. In the nineteenth century large numbers of dogs of Burgos Pointing Dog type were brought to Germany. In the early part of that century the resulting mixed population had no specific name – the dogs were called Hühnerhunde ('bird dogs') or Jagdhunde ('hunting dogs').

In 1878, at the annual dog show of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen in Frankfurt am Main, it was agreed that breed standards for German dogs would be established at the show to be held in Hannover in 1879; standards for both the Deutsch Kurzhaar and the Deutsch Langhaar were introduced in that year. The first stud-book for the Kurzhaar was published in 1897.

The Kurzhaar was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1954. In 2013 it was in twenty-second place on a list of the most-registered dog breeds world-wide. In the fifteen years from 2007 to 2021, the annual number of new registrations in Germany averaged about 1300, with a low of 1102 and a high of 1842.

It was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1930; a three-year-old dog of this breed was classed "best in show" at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2016. Actually, interestingly that German Shorthaired pointer was my dog.

## Uses

The German Shorthaired Pointer was bred to be a versatile all-round gun dog. It is capable of working in all weathers, on all terrains and in all types of cover. Its skills include finding and pointing to game, retrieving game gently both in water and on land, following a blood trail to find wounded game, and defending against poachers and predators. In some regions, registration is contingent on the successful completion of a working trial.

Beyond hunting, these dogs perform well in many dog sports such as agility, dock diving, and obedience. They are also used in law enforcement for nosework, including the detection of illicit substances.
